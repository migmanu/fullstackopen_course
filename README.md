# fullstackopen_course
My submissions to the Fullstackopen Course by the University of Helsinki. 


I decided to go with one repository for the whole course. 
Each section, and each activity in each section, has its own directory.
I followed the recommended structure:

> part0
  >0.4 new note
  >0.5 Single page app
  >0.6 new note
etc.
